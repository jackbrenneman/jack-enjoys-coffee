## What is this?

This is a site I'm making that I hope will become a place where I can input all the coffee I drink. Once I have that data, I hope to do some analysis and make some infographs so that I can see what I'm drinking and how in some cool ways. I got the idea from Spotify's "Wrapped" feature, which gives you a big overview of your year of listening to music. I look forward to it every year, and I kinda just wanna do the same thing except for my coffee drinking.

I'm hoping to make it so eventually anyone could use it if they want, but for now I'm just trying to make it a fun side project so I don't get burnt out. If you're reading this and want to help out, I'm all for that! Clone this bad boy and send in some PRs if you're feeling it.

## Available Scripts

### `npm run dev`

This basically just runs `npm start` and `npm run server` in parallel.<br />
The `npm start` part just starts a local development server which you can open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project in the browser. It will reload as you make changes.
The `npm run server` part starts another local server which you can open at [http://localhost:3001/graphql](http://localhost:3001/graphql) to view the Graphiql interface in the browser. The Graphiql interface is super hepful to help see the API of the project. If you want to learn more about how to use the interface, you can check that out [here](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphiql#readme). The server restarts when you make changes, but you'll need to refresh the Graphiql page to see the changes.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
